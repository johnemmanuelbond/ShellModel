    "This notebook serves as an overview of the functionality of the ShellModel library. This code uses a finite-element-analysis approach to track hydrodyamics of particles within fluids of a generalized tensor viscosity (such as liquid crystals). By the end of the tutorial you should be able to form your colloidal particles, compute their hydrodynamic properties, include independently interacting particles, and collect output movies.\n",

    "The Shell Model functions off of five python scripts/classes contained in the ShellModel [repository](https://github.com/johnemmanuelbond/ShellModel).\n",
    "\n",
    "supports.py contains a list of imports (mpl, numpy, etc.) and several quality of life functions that the other classes use frequently. \n",
    "\n",
    "Collections.py is a class to represent a rigid collection of spheres. The class contains code to form a collection out of coordinates, translate, rotate, clone, or merge collections, as well as several preset collections: spheres, cylinders, disks, and (newly) helices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzer.py is a class containing the math used to compute translational and rotational (wip) drag tensors for these collection objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "ParticleArray.py is a class which allows a user to have several collection objects move independently of each other, but still affect each other hydrodynamically via Analyzer.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "ArrayMove.py is a class which uses the functionality of ParticleArray to track the movement of the array over time and turn it into an mp4 or series of stills which best describe the motion.\n",

    "In order to access these classes you will need to download git, and, if you would like, clone the [repository](https://github.com/johnemmanuelbond/ShellModel) into a directory of your choice. However, I will teach you how to do it all directly from a jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the snippet of code I recommend using. It uses the os package to set up a folder called \"ShellModel\" to contain the aforementioned five files. This code doesn't attempt to clone the directory if you already have it, and imports all the classes/functions/definitions from all the five files so you don't need to call them in an awkward way."
