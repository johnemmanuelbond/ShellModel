abstract = {Abstract We have developed an improved theory for calculating the translational frictional coefficients of rigid macromolecular complexes composed of unequal spherical subunits. The Yamakawa hydrodynamic interaction tensor, which improves on the Oseen tensor by taking account of the finite sizes of the frictional subunits, has been generalized to accomodate nonidentical subunits. Iterative numerical methods are described for solving the set of simultaneous hydrodynamic interaction equations, thus avoiding preaveraging. The theory is applied to prolate ellipsoids of revolution, to lollipops, and to dumbbells, and comparison is made with earlier, more approximate theories.},

abstract = {Abstract We have used the modified Oseen hydrodynamic interaction tensor along with iterative numerical solution of the coupled hydrodynamic interaction equations to calculate the rotational diffusion coefficients of macromolecular complexes composed of nonidentical spherical subunits. For the one structure, a prolate ellipsoid of revolution, for which exact solutions are available, a subunit model with the same length and volume gives asymptotic agreement with the Perrin equations. Other structures considered include plane polygonal rings, lollipops, and dumbbells.},

    abstract = "{The goal of this paper is to summarize and clarify the scope and interpretation of the validation procedure presented in the V\&V20-2009 ASME Standard. In V\&V20-2009, validation is an assessment of the model error, without regard to the assessment satisfying validation requirements. Therefore, validation is not considered as a pass/fail exercise. The purpose of the validation procedure is the estimation of the accuracy of a mathematical model for specified validation variables (also known as quantities of interest, system responses or figures of merit) at a specified validation point for cases in which the conditions of the actual experiment are simulated. The proposed procedure can be applied to variables defined by a scalar.For the sake of clarity, the paper reiterates the development and assumptions behind the V\&V20-2009 procedure that requires the knowledge of the experimental values D and simulation values S at the set point and an estimate of the experimental, numerical and parameter uncertainties. The difference E between S and D is the centre of the interval that should contain the model error (with a certain degree of confidence) and the width of the interval is obtained from the validation uncertainty that is a consequence of the combination of the experimental, numerical and parameter uncertainties.The paper presents the alternatives to address parameter uncertainty and expands upon the interpretation of the final result. The paper also includes two examples demonstrating the application of the V\&V20-2009 validation procedure including one problem from V\&V10.1-2012 on solid mechanics.}",
